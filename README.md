# Diwali_sales_Analysis

#Project Overview
Hey there! The Diwali Sales Analysis project is my exciting journey into exploring sales data from the festive Diwali season. Using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, I’ve crunched the numbers and created some eye-catching visuals to uncover trends and insights about customer behavior and sales patterns.

#Key Objectives

Load and clean the Diwali sales dataset effectively.  
Transform the data, handle missing values, and adjust data types as needed.  
Create meaningful visualizations to highlight sales trends.  
Extract valuable insights to understand customer preferences and purchasing power.

#Tools & Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language.  
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.  
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating insightful visualizations.  
Jupyter Notebook: Environment for coding and analysis.

#Data Analysis Steps

Imported the Diwali sales dataset using pandas with proper encoding.  
Explored the data structure and removed irrelevant columns.  
Handled null values by dropping rows with missing 'Amount' data.  
Converted data types (e.g., 'Amount' to integer) and renamed columns (e.g., 'Marital_Status' to 'Shaadi').  
Grouped and aggregated data by various categories for deeper analysis.

#Key Findings

The dataset originally had 11,251 entries, reduced to 11,239 after cleaning.  
Females (7,832) outnumber males (3,407) in purchases, with females showing higher purchasing power.  
Married individuals, especially women, contribute significantly to sales.  
Top occupations driving sales include IT Sector, Healthcare, and Aviation.  
Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka lead in total sales and order volume.

#Conclusion

This project has been a fun and insightful dive into Diwali sales data, showcasing how Python and its libraries can turn raw numbers into actionable insights. The findings suggest that targeting married women and key occupational groups in high-sales states could boost future sales strategies. There’s still room to explore more trends and refine the analysis further!
